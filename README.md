# Dr.Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine Clone

This is a solo project to recreate a game that is fundamentally identical to Sega's game, "Dr.Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine" which derives from Puyo Puyo, which is similiar to Tetris. I'm creating this as a start to my game dev career and using this as a learning experience.
